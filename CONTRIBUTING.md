Thanks for contributing! PRs are welcome. This page covers the review process every PR goes through before it can be merged.

## PR review flow

1. Open your PR and get it through PR validation. Add the `full-sweep-fail-fast` label (strongly recommended because a broken change wastes one job per matrix rather than the whole fan-out). Use `full-sweep-enabled` only if you need jobs to keep running past a failure. Let the benchmark sweep run and get a green full sweep, including evals, on a commit in your PR.
2. Request a review from your respective company's [CODEOWNER](.github/CODEOWNERS).
3. The CODEOWNER reviews and posts the **PR Review Checklist** sign-off (see below) in their approval comment.
4. Only after the checklist sign-off is posted should you ping a core maintainer on Slack for final approval.
5. An authorized maintainer posts `/reuse-sweep-run` (see below) and the PR is merged via the reuse path.

**Performance changelog requirement:** Every change that can affect benchmark performance and every recipe addition or modification **MUST** append a new entry to the physical end of `perf-changelog.yaml`. Historical entries **MUST NOT** be edited.

## The PR Review Checklist (CODEOWNER sign-off)

When a CODEOWNER approves a PR, they must fill in the latest [PR_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](docs/PR_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) template in their approval comment.

A friendly reminder. Please follow the latest checklist template **correctly**:

- Always copy the template from the **current** [docs/PR_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](docs/PR_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) on `main`. The checklist evolves, and a sign-off made from a stale copy will be flagged as missing items.
- Keep the template's opening phrase intact:

  > As a PR reviewer and CODEOWNER, I have reviewed this and have:

  Our CI verification workflow, [`codeowner-signoff-verify.yml`](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeowner-signoff-verify.yml), triggers on exactly this phrase. **If your approval comment does not follow the checklist template, including that phrase, the sign-off verification CI will not trigger at all**, and your sign-off won't count toward merge.
- The sign-off can be posted as a regular conversation comment, a review summary, or an inline review comment. All three trigger verification.
- Fill in the "Additional detail section" with the links the checklist asks for (validation/eval workflow runs, the corresponding [vLLM recipe](https://github.com/vllm-project/recipes) / [SGLang cookbook](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/docs_new) PR, and any exception reasoning).

Once the sign-off is posted, CI independently re-verifies the claims that gate a merge, including CODEOWNER status, a green sweep and evals on a commit in the PR, the linked recipe, the `/reuse-sweep-run` command, use of the latest checklist template, upstream [vLLM](https://hub.docker.com/u/vllm)/[SGLang](https://hub.docker.com/u/lmsysorg) images, no architecture-changing benchmark hacks, and chat-template usage for speculative decoding. It then posts a verdict comment on the PR. Checkmarks are not taken on trust, so please only check items you have actually verified.

## Reusing your PR's green sweep at merge with `/reuse-sweep-run`

A full benchmark sweep is expensive GPU time, and the runners are shared by every open PR. Without reuse, an approved PR's sweep would run **twice**, once for PR validation and again on `main` after merge. The reuse path avoids that:

- After your PR has an eligible green full sweep, an authorized maintainer (`OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`) comments `/reuse-sweep-run` on the PR (optionally pinning a specific run: `/reuse-sweep-run <run_id>`).
- The merge-to-`main` run then validates and ingests the PR sweep's artifacts instead of re-running the whole sweep on `main`.
- **This reduces CI queue time for everyone.** Each reused merge frees hours of GPU runner time for other PRs, so please prefer the reuse path over merging without it. A green sweep alone is not enough. The `/reuse-sweep-run` comment must be on record (the sign-off verification checks for it), otherwise `main` silently re-runs the full sweep.
- Reuse does not require retaining a sweep label. The bot reacts to the command with 👍 when accepted or 👎 when rejected, with details in the Actions run summary; source artifacts are revalidated at merge.
- `utils/merge_with_reuse.sh <pr-number>` is the supported merge path. It posts the command, syncs the branch with `main`, waits for checks, and squash-merges. See the [workflows README](.github/workflows/README.md#reusing-an-approved-pr-full-sweep) for eligibility details.

## Adding points to the latest curve with `append-only`

When a PR only adds generated points to an existing curve, mark every new changelog
entry with `append-only: true`. Additions may introduce new concurrency values or new
recipe variants, such as another tensor-parallelism value. Sweep setup compares the
generated matrices at the base and head revisions, runs only the newly added points,
and emits metadata that lets InferenceX-app extend the most recent matching curve
instead of presenting the partial run as a separate curve.

This mode is intentionally narrow, but it is not based on a file allowlist. Supporting
code, benchmark scripts, launchers, and other files may change when their behavioral
effect is exclusive to the newly appended points named by the changelog. No changed
benchmark path may execute for or alter an existing point. Every selected config and
scenario must already exist, and every point generated at the base revision must
remain present with the same recipe. The head may contain any additional generated
recipes or points inside that scope, including new topology or other recipe dimensions;
the sweep schedules the generated set difference. Additions must use the same non-null
image and belong to an existing dashboard visual series. Each generated recipe carries
a deterministic fingerprint so two distinct recipes at the same concurrency remain
distinct database points without splitting the visual curve. Removing or modifying an
existing point, or changing shared logic that can affect one, is rejected. Append-only
entries cannot be mixed with regular entries or eval-selection modifiers in the same
sweep. The matrix validator enforces the additive generated-matrix invariant; the human
and AI reviewers must inspect the complete diff and verify behavioral isolation. The
mechanical comparison renders each config revision with its own generator, validation
code, and runner metadata. Launcher and benchmark-script changes still rely on
complete-diff review because matrix equality alone cannot prove their runtime
control-flow isolation.

```yaml
- config-keys:
    - dsv4-fp4-b300-vllm-mtp
  description:
    - "Add TP8 at concurrency 12 and 16 to the existing curve"
  pr-link: https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/XXX
  append-only: true
```

## AMD cluster: never leave root-owned files in runner workspaces

Multi-node benchmarks on the AMD MI355X TW cluster submit Slurm jobs whose containers often run as **root**. If those containers write files (typically `benchmark_logs/logs/slurm_job-*`) into the GitHub Actions runner workspace and the job is **cancelled** before teardown runs, the root-owned directories are stranded. The runner user cannot delete them, so `actions/checkout` fails with:

```
Error: File was unable to be removed
Error: EACCES: permission denied, rmdir '.../benchmark_logs/logs/slurm_job-<id>'
```

**This bricks every subsequent job on that runner** until someone with `sudo` on the shared `/it-share` storage manually removes the files. Because all AMD MI355X sweeps share the same runner pool, a single stranded root-owned directory blocks the entire queue for everyone.

**Rules for benchmark scripts and Slurm containers:**

1. **Never write as root into the runner workspace.** If your container must run as root, write outputs to a separate scratch directory outside `_work/` (e.g. `/tmp` or a dedicated staging path).
2. **If root writes are unavoidable**, add a cleanup trap or teardown step that `chown`s or `rm`s all root-owned files under the workspace **before** the job exits, including on cancellation (`trap cleanup EXIT`).
3. **Test your teardown path.** Cancel a running benchmark mid-flight and verify no root-owned files remain in the workspace.

If you find a stranded root-owned file blocking runners, the recovery procedure is documented in [`.claude/commands/clean-amd-mi355-runner-root-files.md`](.claude/commands/clean-amd-mi355-runner-root-files.md): SSH into the hop host with `sudo`, scan the `_work` directories, and delete the offending files.

## After merging

**PR authors are responsible for ensuring that after merging, all GitHub Action jobs fully pass.** A lot of the time, failures are just flakes and simply re-running the failed jobs will fix it. [See GitHub's docs on re-running failed jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/re-run-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-failed-jobs-in-a-workflow).
