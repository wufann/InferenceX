# Agentic trace replay benchmark for Kimi-K3 MXFP4 on MI355X / MI350X (gfx950)
# using ATOM with DSpark speculative decoding.
#
# Companion to kimik3_fp4_mi355x_mtp.sh, which runs the same checkpoint under
# vLLM, so the two arms are directly comparable.
#
# TP=8 ONLY, for the same reason as the vLLM arm: the MXFP4 checkpoint is
# 1.561 TB decimal (~195 GB/GPU across 8 GPUs of the 288 GB part), and TP=4
# would need ~390 GB/GPU and cannot load.
#
# The ATOM image is purpose-built for K3, so apply_k3_container_patches.sh is
# NOT sourced here -- that script reproduces a specific patched vLLM container
# byte-for-byte and does not apply to this stack.
#
# Three serving bands, one fresh server per concurrency point:
#   interactive (1, 2, 4)         DCP1, DSpark 7, no LMCache
#   mid         (8, 12, 14, 16)   DCP8, DSpark 3, LMCache 128 GB/rank
#   throughput  (32, 40, 56, 64)  DCP8, no draft model, LMCache 128 or 192 GB/rank
#
# Required env vars:
#   MODEL, MODEL_PATH, TP, DCP_SIZE, CONC, KV_OFFLOADING, KV_OFFLOAD_BACKEND,
#   TOTAL_CPU_DRAM_GB, RESULT_DIR, DURATION, EP_SIZE, DP_ATTENTION

# ---- Per-concurrency knobs --------------------------------------------------
# Three bands, and every knob below moves with the band:
#
#   interactive (1, 2, 4)        the latency floor. Everything GPU-resident, no
#                                decode context parallelism, the deepest draft
#                                the golden curve publishes, 8192-token prefill
#                                step.
#   mid         (8, 12, 14, 16)  decode is KV-bandwidth-bound over 100k+ token
#                                agentic contexts, so DCP8 shards the KV read
#                                across all 8 GPUs, the LMCache DRAM tier backs
#                                the paged KV, and ReplaySSM rebuilds the KDA
#                                recurrent state from the checkpoint ring.
#   throughput  (32, 40, 56, 64) past the throughput knee the draft forward no
#                                longer pays for itself against the resident
#                                batch, so no draft model is loaded and
#                                ReplaySSM goes back off.
#
# DCP itself is not chosen here: it comes from dcp-size in
# configs/amd-master.yaml, which leaves it at 1 for concurrency 1-4 and sets 8
# from concurrency 8 up. Nor is the LMCache tier, which follows kv-offloading in
# the same file.
#
# CUDAGRAPH_MAX_NUM_SEQS is the in-flight window the CUDA graphs are captured
# for and defaults to 2 * CONC, which is what the AgentX client can put in
# flight per lane. Only concurrency 14 pins it, because it runs the concurrency
# 16 server verbatim.
