## Prepare a worktree

Source: [`docs/agent-guide.md`](./agent-guide.md), [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

From a clean repository root:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git fetch origin
git worktree add -b config/<slug> .worktrees/<slug> origin/main
cd .worktrees/<slug>
git status --short --branch
```

1. Confirm the path, branch, base commit, and status before editing.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, then the closest working config, script, launcher, and recipe end to end.
3. Record the exact config key(s) the changelog and generator must select.
4. Preserve unrelated work. Do not reset, clean, rebase, or delete files you did not create.
5. Keep config work isolated until local generation succeeds. Do not consume GPU time to discover YAML or routing errors.

## Add a model + hardware recipe

Detailed source: [`.claude/commands/add-model-hardware.md`](../.claude/commands/add-model-hardware.md). Field source: [`configs/CONFIGS.md`](../configs/CONFIGS.md).
STP (Single Token Prediction) is vanilla autoregressive decoding with one token per forward pass. MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) predicts multiple tokens per forward pass through native heads or speculative decoding.

1. **Fix the identity.** Confirm the exact checkpoint ID, model prefix, precision, architecture, native context, target SKU, framework, and whether decoding is STP, native MTP, or draft-model speculation. Verify the image tag exists. Never invent one.
2. **Choose two kinds of sibling.** Read the same model on another SKU and another model on the target SKU. Also read the target [`runners/launch_*.sh`](../runners/) and shared [`benchmark_lib.sh`](../benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh).
3. **Add the runtime script.** Put the single-node script under [`benchmarks/single_node/fixed_seq_len/`](../benchmarks/single_node/fixed_seq_len/). Preserve the proven sibling's env propagation, parser flags, attention/MoE backend, KV-cache dtype, graph/eager mode, cache setup, and context handling.
4. **Add the master entry.** Use [`amd-master.yaml`](../configs/amd-master.yaml) for `mi*`. Otherwise, use [`nvidia-master.yaml`](../configs/nvidia-master.yaml). Set exact `image`, `model`, `model-prefix`, `runner`, `precision`, `framework`, scenarios, and supported search spaces.
5. **Size from evidence.** Mirror proven parallelism layouts and trim unsupported ones. Latency TP rows normally start at concurrency 1. Do not copy large-memory TP/EP layouts onto a smaller SKU.
6. **Check launcher routing.** The launcher must resolve the new filename, including framework and `_mtp` suffixes. Simulate STP and MTP resolution and confirm each selected file exists.
7. **Append one changelog entry** for the exact new key. See [Append the changelog safely](#append-the-changelog-safely).
8. **Validate syntax and generated output.** Inspect image, model, runner, ISL/OSL, `max-model-len`, concurrency, TP/PP/EP/DCP/PCP, and `spec-decoding`.

A `MODELS.md` row alone is not an executable recipe. The complete path is benchmark script + master entry + launcher routing + changelog trigger + generated matrix.

## Change a master config

Sources: [`configs/CONFIGS.md`](../configs/CONFIGS.md), [`validation.py`](../utils/matrix_logic/validation.py), [`generate_sweep_configs.py`](../utils/matrix_logic/generate_sweep_configs.py).

1. Locate the exact key and read its whole entry plus adjacent siblings.
2. Use only documented kebab-case fields. The schema forbids extras. A plausible-looking field is not accepted automatically.
3. Trace every changed field through generator output, workflow input, launcher, and benchmark script. YAML acceptance only proves shape, not runtime use.
4. Keep the correct layer authoritative:
   - master YAML: matrix identity, labels, search spaces, and emitted metadata.
   - benchmark script: serve/client behavior.
   - launcher: routing, mounts, model paths, image startup, and cluster behavior.
   - external/checked-in recipe: framework-specific multi-node runtime.
5. For topology changes, calculate GPUs before editing and compare with the target fleet.
6. For srt-slurm, update recipe and master entry together. For llm-d, update the llm-d recipe/orchestration and master entry together.
7. Append the trigger entry, generate only the affected key first, and inspect every emitted point.

## Register and set up a runner

Setup source: [`utils/runner_setup/RUNNER_SETUP.md`](../utils/runner_setup/RUNNER_SETUP.md). Config source: [`configs/CONFIGS.md#runners`](../configs/CONFIGS.md#runners).

### Repository registration

1. Create `runners/launch_<base-name>.sh` for a new fleet, or update the existing launcher.
2. Add each exact registered runner name under the intended `labels:` key in [`configs/runners.yaml`](../configs/runners.yaml). New names use `<base-name>_<NN>` with zero-padded indices.
3. If generation needs fleet facts, add a matching `hardware:` entry with positive `available-cpu-dram-mib` and `gpus-per-node`.
4. Use an exact `cluster:<name>` label when facts depend on one physical fleet. Agentic configs require it.
5. Add/update master entries to use that label. Generate a targeted matrix and confirm the selected concrete names.

The runner-name prefix is load-bearing: workflow routing uses `launch_${RUNNER_NAME%%_*}.sh`. Therefore `<base-name>` must match a launcher and must not contain `_`.

### Host setup

1. Decide the runner user and shared storage. `_work` must be visible to login and compute nodes.
2. Confirm `curl`, `tar`, `tmux`, and, for Slurm, `sinfo`/`srun`/`sbatch` are on the registration shell's `PATH`.
3. Obtain repo-admin authentication and a fresh registration token. It expires after about one hour.
4. Run the documented [`setup.sh`](../utils/runner_setup/setup.sh) with token, runner URL, index range, base directory, base name, and labels.
5. Start with [`start_runners.sh`](../utils/runner_setup/start_runners.sh).
6. Verify every runner is **Idle** in [repository runner settings](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/settings/actions/runners) before adding it to sweep traffic.
7. Verify launcher mounts for `_work`, HF cache, staged weights, and squash images from a compute node. Root containers must not leave root-owned files in the shared workspace.

## Register an srt-slurm recipe

Mapping source: [`benchmarks/multi_node/srt-slurm-recipes/RECIPES.md`](../benchmarks/multi_node/srt-slurm-recipes/RECIPES.md). Checked-in recipes: [`benchmarks/multi_node/srt-slurm-recipes/`](../benchmarks/multi_node/srt-slurm-recipes/).

1. Locate the exact upstream [NVIDIA/srt-slurm](https://github.com/NVIDIA/srt-slurm) recipe and record its commit-pinned source path.
2. Stage the YAML under the matching checked-in recipe tree. Read the closest sibling and selected cluster launcher.
3. Map source fields to the master search-space entry: resource worker counts → `num-worker`, TP/EP/DP-attention → worker topology, benchmark concurrencies → `conc-list`, and recipe path → `additional-settings: ["CONFIG_FILE=..."]`.
4. Add/update the matching [`nvidia-master.yaml`](../configs/nvidia-master.yaml) entry in the same change. Keep worker counts, TP/PP/EP/DCP/PCP, hardware, router, transfer engine, and concurrency labels synchronized.
5. For an image bump, make recipe `model.container` exactly equal master `image`. The launcher uses the master image as the container-alias key.
6. Run the recipe's documented `srtctl` validation, then generate the master key and compare every frontend label/topology field with the recipe.
7. Append the changelog entry.

Do not ship one side alone. `srtctl` reads the recipe, while matrix generation reads the master config. Recipe-only changes can mislabel results. Master-only changes do not alter the deployed recipe.

## Register an llm-d recipe

Sources: [`benchmarks/llm-d/README.md`](../benchmarks/llm-d/README.md), [`benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d/README.md`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d/README.md), [`llm-d-recipes/`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d-recipes/), and the current [`llmd-vllm` benchmark wrapper](../benchmarks/multi_node/dsv4_fp4_gb200_llmd-vllm-disagg.sh).

llm-d is not the srt-slurm path: InferenceX owns the Slurm allocation and starts one container per node.

1. Copy the nearest YAML under [`benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d-recipes/`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d-recipes/) and set EPP plugins/scheduling, role-specific `extra-args`/`env`, and optional `slurm.time_limit`.
2. Add/update the `llmd-vllm` master entry. Set `multinode: true`, `disagg: true`, router metadata, `kv-p2p-transfer`, prefill/decode worker topology, concurrency, and `CONFIG_FILE=<basename>.yaml` in `additional-settings`.
3. Keep `PREFILL_NODES`, `DECODE_NODES`, `GPUS_PER_NODE`, and worker counts consistent with the allocation and with each role's DP/TP/EP layout.
4. Confirm [`submit.sh`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d/submit.sh) → [`job.slurm`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d/job.slurm) → [`server.sh`](../benchmarks/multi_node/llm-d/server.sh) propagation and the selected wrapper/launcher route.
5. Verify file discovery. The decode leader creates `/tmp/endpoints.yaml`. Prefill endpoints use vLLM port 8200, while decode endpoints use sidecar port 8000. Names must be unique, addresses must be literal IPv4, and ports must be strings in `1..65535`.
6. Confirm EPP loads discovery before Envoy receives traffic and role labels select the proper prefill/decode backends.
7. Generate the key, inspect topology and `additional-settings`, then append the changelog.

A missing/unset `CONFIG_FILE` silently selects the image's `/etc/epp/config.yaml` fallback and removes recipe-specific vLLM flags. Treat that as a validation failure unless fallback is explicitly intended.

## Update an image

Sources: [`AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants`](../AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants), the matching master configs, runtime scripts, and checked-in recipes.

1. Verify the exact upstream registry tag or digest exists and is appropriate for CUDA/ROCm and the target architecture.
2. Find every affected config key, runtime script, Dockerfile, and checked-in recipe. Do not assume the master YAML is the only image reference.
3. Update the master `image` and any required env vars, flags, package versions, or patches as one coherent change.
4. For srt-slurm, update `model.container` and keep it identical to master `image`.
5. For llm-d, distinguish the serving image selected by the master config from the build source in [`benchmarks/llm-d/Dockerfile`](../benchmarks/llm-d/Dockerfile). Update both only when the build contract changes.
6. Append a changelog entry selecting all affected keys (wildcards are allowed when intentional), including old/new versions and material runtime changes.
7. Generate each affected family and verify no stale tag survives in its runtime path.

## Add or change MTP

Sources: [`AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants`](../AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants), [MTP appendix in the model+hardware playbook](../.claude/commands/add-model-hardware.md#appendix--mtp--eagle3-spec-decoding-variant), and current [`*_mtp.sh` siblings](../benchmarks/single_node/fixed_seq_len/).

1. Confirm native MTP modules versus an external draft. For a draft, verify exact model ID, method (for example `eagle3`), and recommended speculative-token count from the model/upstream recipe.
2. Copy a working sibling for the same model and backend. Preserve its speculative config, attention backend, token count, model patches, and dependency setup.
3. Every `*_mtp.sh` must pass `--use-chat-template` to `run_benchmark_serving`. Raw prompts silently depress acceptance.
4. Size graph capture for at least `CONC * (1 + NUM_SPEC_TOKENS)`, rounded as the sibling does and capped at the framework limit (the current vLLM playbook caps at 2048).
5. Keep backend differences: do not copy CUDA-only drafter attention pins or patches into ROCm recipes.
6. Set `spec-decoding: mtp` in the relevant search-space entries and add `_mtp` launcher suffix routing. For a draft-model mode supported by the schema, use the matching generated value deliberately. Do not infer it from a filename.
7. Add script + master entry + launcher routing + changelog together.
8. Run Bash syntax and generation checks. Inspect `spec-decoding`, draft/native method, token count, chat-template use, capture range, and resolved script.

## Validate

Run the smallest checks that cover the edited layers.

### YAML parse

```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('configs/<nvidia|amd>-master.yaml')); yaml.safe_load(open('configs/runners.yaml')); yaml.safe_load(open('perf-changelog.yaml'))"
```

### Benchmark and launcher syntax

```bash
bash -n benchmarks/<path>/<script>.sh
bash -n runners/launch_<cluster>.sh
```

### Exact-key schema + matrix generation

```bash
uv run --no-project --exclude-newer PT12H --python 3.12 --with pydantic --with pyyaml \
  utils/matrix_logic/generate_sweep_configs.py test-config \
  --config-files configs/<nvidia|amd>-master.yaml \
  --runner-config configs/runners.yaml \
  --config-keys <exact-key>
```

### Filtered family generation

```bash
uv run --no-project --exclude-newer PT12H --python 3.12 --with pydantic --with pyyaml \
  utils/matrix_logic/generate_sweep_configs.py full-sweep \
  --config-files configs/<nvidia|amd>-master.yaml \
  --runner-config configs/runners.yaml \
  --model-prefix <prefix> \
  --framework <framework> \
  --precision <precision> \
  --runner-type <runner> \
  --seq-lens 1k1k 8k1k
```

Inspect, do not merely count, the emitted `model`, `image`, `runner`, scenario, concurrency, `max-model-len`, TP/PP/EP/DCP/PCP, prefill/decode worker blocks, hardware, router, KV transfer, eval flags, `additional-settings`, and `spec-decoding`.

If schema or generator behavior changed, run its focused suite:

```bash
python -m pytest utils/matrix_logic/ -v
```

For srt-slurm, also run the upstream recipe checker/`srtctl` command documented for that recipe. For llm-d, validate recipe YAML and exercise the allocation/discovery path on the intended Slurm fleet. Local matrix generation cannot prove endpoint discovery.

## Avoid schema and topology traps

Enforced details come from [`validation.py`](../utils/matrix_logic/validation.py) and are summarized in [`configs/CONFIGS.md`](../configs/CONFIGS.md):

- Schemas use `extra='forbid'`. Use kebab-case aliases exactly.
- Choose either `conc-start` + `conc-end` **or** non-empty `conc-list`, never both. Values must be positive and start must not exceed end.
- `pp`, `dcp-size`, and `pcp-size` are positive integers. `dcp-size` must divide `tp`.
- Per-worker GPU demand is `num-worker * tp * pp * pcp-size`. DCP reuses TP GPUs and does not multiply allocation.
- Single-node topology fields live in the search-space entry. Multi-node fields live independently under `prefill` and `decode`.
- Heterogeneous `hardware` must appear on both worker blocks or neither. It records result metadata and does not schedule runners.
- `disagg: true` requires `multinode: true` and `kv-p2p-transfer` at top level or on every search-space entry.
- Declare `router` and `kv-p2p-transfer` at exactly one scope: top level or search-space, not both.
- Router metadata requires its component's real name and release/package/commit version. An image tag is not a component version.
- Agentic configs require an exact `cluster:<name>` runner.
- Setting a field only emits an env/workflow value. Confirm the selected script consumes it.
- Scenario `max-model-len` is derived from ISL + OSL + slack. Do not hardcode the checkpoint's full context for an 8k1k/1k8k recipe.

## Append the changelog safely

Sources: [`AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants`](../AGENTS.md#non-negotiable-benchmark-invariants), [`perf-changelog.yaml`](../perf-changelog.yaml).

1. Make all executable config changes first and identify the exact keys.
2. Append a new block at the physical end of `perf-changelog.yaml`:

```yaml
- config-keys:
    - <exact-key-or-intentional-wildcard>
  description:
    - "What changed"
    - "Image/topology/runtime detail"
  pr-link: https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/<number>
```

3. Before the PR exists, the model+hardware playbook permits `pr-link: TBD`. Replace it with the real URL immediately after creating the PR.
4. Never prepend, insert chronologically, sort, reformat, or run a formatter over the file.
5. Never delete or normalize existing whitespace, including trailing spaces on blank separators. CI depends on historical bytes.
6. If the file conflicts with `main`, restore the current `main` version and re-append only this branch's entries. Do not hand-merge reordered history.
7. Parse the file and confirm the generated changelog selection includes the intended keys before requesting a sweep.

## Stop conditions

Stop before dispatching GPU work or claiming the configuration complete when any condition below holds. Obtain the missing fact or fix the source mismatch. Do not guess.

- Exact checkpoint, precision, architecture, native context, framework, draft model/method, or image tag is unverified.
- No proven sibling covers the target model/backend/SKU, and required runtime flags or memory limits remain unknown.
- Runner user, shared mounts, staged model path, GPU count, host DRAM, Slurm behavior, or root-file cleanup is unknown. Runner registration credentials are also a hard prerequisite for host setup.
- The registered runner prefix has no matching launcher, a matrix resolves to a nonexistent script, or the runner is not **Idle**.
- Calculated topology exceeds the fleet, DCP does not divide TP, heterogeneous hardware metadata is one-sided, or generated topology differs from the intended recipe.
- An srt-slurm recipe and master entry disagree, `model.container != image`, or upstream recipe validation has not run.
- An llm-d recipe is missing and would fall back unintentionally, allocation counts disagree, or endpoint discovery cannot satisfy literal-IPv4/unique-name/valid-port rules.
- An MTP script lacks chat-template benchmarking, the speculative method/token count is unverified, or graph capture exceeds the backend limit.
- The changelog change would modify historical bytes, is not at EOF, has a conflict, or still has `TBD` when the PR is otherwise ready for sweep.
- YAML, Bash, strict schema, exact-key generation, launcher simulation, or recipe validation fails.

A configuration is ready for sweep only when the executable files agree, the exact key generates, the runtime route exists, the changelog selects it, and all layer-specific checks above pass.
