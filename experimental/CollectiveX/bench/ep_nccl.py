"""NCCL EP adapter: NVIDIA's native MoE dispatch/combine on the NCCL Device API.

NCCL EP (github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-extensions, arXiv 2603.13606) is a ground-up MoE
communication library built on NCCL's Device API — LSA (NVLink load/store) intra-node and
GIN (GPU-Initiated Networking) inter-node — with two algorithms selected per case:
  normal      -> HIGH_THROUGHPUT (HT), the Hybrid-EP-derived prefill/train path. FLAT recv
                 layout ``[N, hidden]`` (one row per received token, no expert structure) with
                 an unweighted rank-sum combine — identical semantics to deepep-v2 normal.
  low-latency -> LOW_LATENCY (LL), the DeepEP-derived decode path. EXPERT_MAJOR recv layout
                 ``[num_local_experts, max_dispatch*num_ranks, hidden]`` with a source-side
                 weighted-kernel-sum combine — identical semantics to deepep-v2 low-latency.
Because both map exactly onto the two combine contracts CollectiveX already models, the
scale_up_domain two-level combine oracle in ep_harness applies unchanged.

BF16 only for now: v0.2 grows a real quantization surface (DispatchQuantizationRecipe.FWD /
DS_FP8E3M4 for FP8 dispatch, experimental CombineQuantizationRecipe.NVFP4), but wiring it into
the fp8_consume model is its own bring-up, so this adapter still does not override the FP8
encode hooks (SUPPORTED_PRECISIONS=("bf16",)).

Communicator bootstrap: NCCL EP forms its OWN NCCL communicator (separate from PyTorch's
process group) via ``Communicator.init(nranks, rank, unique_id)``. Upstream broadcasts the
unique id with MPI; CollectiveX has no MPI, so rank 0 generates the id and we broadcast its
bytes over the already-initialized torch process group (see ``_bootstrap_comm``).

Python bindings are split across two wheels since v0.2: ``nccl-extensions`` owns ``nccl.ep``
(the libnccl_ep.so JIT runtime + Cython bindings) and ``nccl4py`` provides ``nccl.core``
(Communicator/UniqueId). The API surface used here is verified against the published
nccl-extensions wheel and driven exactly as upstream's ep_test.py drives it — every class and
signature this adapter touches is unchanged from v0.1.

        ONE handle per group, rebound per shape — never one handle per shape. `buffer_idx`, the

        offsets into the per-GROUP rdma_buffer: two handles built from the same group config
        resolve to the SAME parity-0/parity-1 count+flag slots and advance their parity
        independently, so one handle's "next buffer, safe to clean" is the other's "current
        buffer, in flight". Interleaving handles therefore corrupts the signalling even when it
        does not hang outright, which makes every latency drawn from such a run suspect. Filed
        upstream as NVIDIA/nccl#2303; reproduced on a stock wheel by ladder [1] (one handle,
        clean) vs ladder [1, 2] (two handles, 64 dispatch + 6 combine receive timeouts -> 719).

        `ncclEpInitHandle` takes no token count and `ncclEpUpdateHandle` is documented as a
        "per-step collective: prepare the handle for the given top-k routing decisions", so
        rebinding IS the intended lifecycle. This also matches the other three backends, which
        each allocate one object sized to the ladder maximum and vary the token count per call.

        Both create_handle and update are collective, and HT additionally performs the metadata
        exchange that fixes the received-token count, so they must run in the same order on
        every rank. They only ever run on a shape CHANGE, and every timed component is preceded
        by an untimed warm() on its own problem — so the collective always lands in warm (or in
        the oracle passes), never inside a timed window. Re-entering with the already-bound
